    "# Inference and Validation\n",

    "Now that you have a trained network, you can use it for making predictions. This is typically called **inference**, a term borrowed from statistics. However, neural networks have a tendency to perform *too well* on the training data and aren't able to generalize to data that hasn't been seen before. This is called **overfitting** and it impairs inference performance. To test for overfitting while training, we measure the performance on data not in the training set called the **validation** set. We avoid overfitting through regularization such as dropout while monitoring the validation performance during training. In this notebook, I'll show you how to do this in PyTorch. \n",

One option is to use the version of the model with the lowest validation loss, here the one around 8-10 training epochs. This strategy is called *early-stopping*. In practice, you'd save the model frequently as you're training then later choose the model with the lowest validation loss.\n",
